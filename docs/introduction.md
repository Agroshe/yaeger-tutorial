# Introduction

In this tutorial you will create a simple game called Waterworld. We start of
with an empty project that does not contain any code. Only the assets and the
project settings are provided. Step-by-step you will be guided in the creation
of simple game, and in doing so, become familiar with many of the features of
Yaeger.

## What we will be building

When this tutorial is completed, we will have a game in which a fish (called 
Hanny) has to navigate through the ocean and pop air bubbles. While doing so,
she has to prevent being bitten by enemies that also prowl the ocean

that supports Java.
