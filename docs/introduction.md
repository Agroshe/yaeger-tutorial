# Introduction

In this tutorial you will create a simple game called Waterworld. We start of
with an empty project that does not contain any code. Only the assets and the
project settings are provided. Step-by-step you will be guided in the creation
of simple game, and in doing so, become familiar with many of the features of
Yaeger.

## Prerequisite

Yaeger requires Java JDK16 or above to work, and can be used with any modern IDE
that supports Java.
