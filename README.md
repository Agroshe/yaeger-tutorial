# Yaeger tutorial: Creating Waterworld
In this tutorial you will create a simple game called Waterworld. 
We start of with an empty project that does not contain any code. 
Only the assets and the project settings are provided. Step-by-step you will be guided in the creation of simple 
game, and in doing so, become familiar with many of the features of Yaeger.

## Requirements
Yaeger requires Java JDK12 or above to work, and can be used with any IDE that supports Java.

## Clone the starter project
We provide a repository, that contains both a starter project and the required assets. Either clone this repository
to your local machine, or download the zip file.

The project is a Maven project, which will be recognized by all modern IDE's. Knowledge of Maven is therefore not required.
But just to paint the full picture, you'll find a `pom.xml` file at the root of the project. This file contains the full
project setup and you will notice the dependency it has on `Yaeger`. 
 
### Importing the project in IntelliJ

### Importing the project in Eclipse
